Hi! This is my first project in web development. I made a landing page for a fictional bakery called "Sweet Branch". 

What I used: 
* HTML5: For the structure of the page. 
* CSS3: I used Flexbox and Grid to make the layout.
*Responsive design: The site changes its size for different screens using the clamp() function. 
* Animations: I added a moving carousel with CSS. 

Important: 
* This is a learning project, not a real shop. 
* I found all the photos on Pinterest. I used them only for practice.
